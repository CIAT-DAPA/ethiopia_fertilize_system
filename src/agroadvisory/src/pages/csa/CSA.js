                        The climate-smart agriculture (CSA) component of the tool provides an integrated approach to managing
                        landscapes—cropland, livestock, forests, and farms —to addresses the interlinked challenges of
                        food security and climate change and enhance productivity and resilience. Practices, technologies,
                        approaches under this category can be included in most of the above ‘packages’ and includes use of
                        improved varieties (drought, disease and heat tolerant), conservation agriculture, crop rotation, intercropping,
                        feed and feeding improvement etc.
