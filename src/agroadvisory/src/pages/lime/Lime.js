                        Soil acidity is one of the major crop production constraints in
                        Ethiopia. Estimates show that about 40% of the total arable land
                        of the country is affected by soil acidity. Application of lime is
                        therefore the strategy to overcome crop production challenge.
                        Supporting the application of lime on acid soils, tailored lime
                        advisory tool is developed to advise farmers about rate of
                        site-specific lime application. Further the tool advises nearest
                        location of lime sources to farms through optimizing lime
                        distribution based on demand and supply.
