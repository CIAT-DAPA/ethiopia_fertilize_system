                        The performances of organic and inorganic inputs are constrained by climatic conditions.
                        The Agroclimatic advisory component of the tool is thus integrated to provide climatic
                        information and agronomic calendars such as onset of rainfall, land preparation, planting,
                        and harvesting dates to extension workers and farmers to facilitate agronomic decision making.
                        In addition to enhancing production, this intervention also helps reduce agricultural production
                        risk due to climate variabilities and change.
