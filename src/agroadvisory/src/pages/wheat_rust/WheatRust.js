                        Wheat rusts are the major disease constraints for Ethiopian wheat
                        farmers. Early detection and timely actionable advice are critical
                        to safeguard crops. In this NextGen platform, advisories being
                        generated from the already developed wheat rust early warning system
                        by the University of Cambridge, the UK Met Office, the Ethiopian
                        Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR), the Ethiopian
                        Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA) and the International Maize
                        and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) are integrated to provide
                        bundle advisory to farmers.
