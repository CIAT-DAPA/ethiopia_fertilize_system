            NextGen Agroadvisory is a tool developed to provide location,
            context, and climate specific agricultural advisories particularly
            related to optimal fertilizer application, integrated soil fertility
            management (ISFM), climate information service, climate smart
            agricultural activities (CSA), pest and disease surveillance, and
            other agricultural investments to different user groups. The app
            provides both pixel level information and generates reports based on
            kebele and woreda levels. The data used in the web app is produced
            based on different methodologies:

          <p className="font-link-body text-justify">
            The fertilizer data stored in the system consists of both elemental
            and compound fertilizer nutrients. It includes n, p, urea, nps,
            compost and vermi-compost. The output is produced based on machine
            learning algorithm.

          <p className="font-link-body text-justify">
            In order to get fertilizer recommendation two categories of data
            were used. An observation data which consists of the fertilizer and
            treatment historical information collected, cleaned and harmonized
            by CoW (Coalition of the willing) and raster covariates available
            publicly were used. These includes:
          </p>
          <ol type="a">
            <li className="font-link-body text-justify">
              Soil data – these are raster covariates collected from soilgrids (
              <a href="https://soilgrids.org/" target="_blank">
                soilgrids.org
              </a>
              ) which contains eleven soil property maps with three different
              depths (0-5cm, 5-15cm and 15-30cm)
            </li>
            <li className="font-link-body text-justify">
              Climate data – acquired from TerraClim (

              ) and consists of four different parameters (precipitation, solar
              radiation, min temperature and max temperature)
            </li>
            <li className="font-link-body text-justify">
              Topographic data – these category includes elevation, slope,
              topographic positioning index (tpi) and topographic ruggedness
              index (tri) collected from amazon web tile services.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h4 className="font-link">Methodology</h4>

          <p className="font-link-body text-justify">
            After acquiring the data, first weighted average for the three soil
            depths was and a single raster file calculated for each soil
            nutrient was generated. Then slope, tpi and tri was calculated from
            the elevation data. Besides the climatic data for each month of the
            growing length was selected. Finally the values of these covariates
            were extracted by the observation data.
          </p>

          <p className="font-link-body text-justify">
            For model calibration, the covariates data extracted was cleaned and
            missing values were removed. Then 80 percent and 20 percent of the
            data was selected for model training and validation respectively. A
            random forest machine learning algorithm is used to calibrate the
            model. For the prediction to be done, first a prediction grid for
            the good, normal and bad year with 25 percent, 50 percent and 75
            percent quantiles respectively were prepared. Finally, the
            prediction was made based on the above three different scenarios.
            During the prediction an interaction matrix for different values of
            nitrogen and phosphorous was used; this produces a prediction of
            several different layer combinations. The optimal yield and the
            optimal n & p values were generated by selecting the optimal values
            from this combination of layers. In addition to generate a report
            based on the admin levels the average values of fertilizer
            recommendations were calculated by Kebele boundaries. Please see the
            workflow below. You can also see the R source code here at {" "}
